## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions (5 Minutes):

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```powershell
cd c:\Users\PC\Documents\gracelandweb
npm install cloudinary sharp
```

**What this installs:**
- `cloudinary@^1.41.0` - Cloudinary Node.js SDK
- `sharp@^0.33.0` - High-performance image processing

---

### Step 2: Get Cloudinary Credentials (FREE)

1. **Sign up**: https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
2. **Login and go to Dashboard**
3. **Copy these values:**

```
Cloud Name: dgxxxxxxxx (example)
API Key: 123456789012345 (example)
API Secret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (example)
```

**Free Tier Includes:**
- âœ… 25 GB storage
- âœ… 25 GB bandwidth/month
- âœ… 25,000 transformations/month
- âœ… More than enough for a church website!

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file (create if it doesn't exist):

```powershell
# Copy from .env.example if needed
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

CLOUDINARY_AUTO_OPTIMIZE=true
CLOUDINARY_QUALITY=auto:good
```

**Replace** `your_cloud_name_here`, `your_api_key_here`, and `your_api_secret_here` with your actual credentials from Step 2.

### Step 4: Railway Environment Variables

Add the same variables to Railway:

1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click your project â†’ Web Service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Click **+ New Variable** and add:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = your_api_secret_here
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER = graceland-church
```

---

### Step 5: Test Locally

```powershell
# Start your server
npm start
```

**Server should show:**
```
ðŸ“¸ Cloudinary Service Initialized
Cloud Name: dgxxxxxxxx âœ…
```

---

### Step 6: Test Upload

1. Open: http://localhost:3000/admin.html
2. Login with your credentials
3. Click "New Post"
4. Click on "Featured Image" area
5. Select an image
6. Watch it upload with progress!

**You should see:**
```
ðŸ“Š Image optimized: 2500KB â†’ 450KB (82% savings)
âœ… Uploaded to Cloudinary: graceland-church/xxxxx
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist:

### Local Testing:
- [ ] Run `npm install`
- [ ] Add Cloudinary credentials to `.env`
- [ ] Start server with `npm start`
- [ ] Check console for "Cloudinary Service Initialized"
- [ ] Upload test image in admin panel
- [ ] Verify image shows in preview

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting:

### Issue: "Cloudinary is not configured"
**Solution:** Check your `.env` file has correct credentials
```powershell
# Verify environment variables are loaded
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log(process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME)"
```

### Issue: Upload fails with "Upload failed"
**Solution:** Check Cloudinary API credentials are correct
- Login to Cloudinary dashboard
- Verify Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret
- Make sure account is active

### Issue: Images not optimizing
**Solution:** Check Sharp installation
```powershell
npm rebuild sharp
```

### Issue: "Module not found: cloudinary"
**Solution:** Run npm install again
```powershell
npm install cloudinary sharp --save
```

### Issue: Local uploads work, Railway uploads fail
**Solution:** Add environment variables to Railway
- Railway Dashboard â†’ Variables tab
- Add all CLOUDINARY_* variables
