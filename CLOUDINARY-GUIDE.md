## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up for Cloudinary (FREE)

1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
2. Sign up with email or GitHub
3. Navigate to Dashboard
4. Copy your credentials:

```
Cloud Name: _______________
API Key: _______________
API Secret: _______________
```

**Free Tier Includes:**

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```powershell
npm install cloudinary sharp
```

**Packages:**
- `cloudinary@^1.41.3` - Cloudinary SDK for uploads & transformations
- `sharp@^0.33.5` - Local image pre-optimization (60-80% size reduction)

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=graceland-church
CLOUDINARY_AUTO_OPTIMIZE=true
CLOUDINARY_QUALITY=auto:good
```

**Important:** Never commit `.env` to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

---

### Step 4: Deploy to Railway

Add the same environment variables to Railway:

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click **Variables** tab
3. Add each variable:
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = your_api_secret
   CLOUDINARY_FOLDER = graceland-church
   ```
4. Redeploy your application

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Upload Flow:
```
User Upload (5MB image)
    ↓
Client-side compression (Browser Canvas API)
    ↓ (reduces to ~1.5MB)
Sharp pre-optimization (Node.js)
    ↓ (reduces to ~800KB)
Cloudinary processing
    ↓ (generates multiple optimized versions)
├─ Thumbnail: 200x200 → 15KB WebP
├─ Small: 400x300 → 50KB WebP
├─ Medium: 800x600 → 150KB WebP
└─ Large: 1200x900 → 250KB WebP
    ↓
CDN Distribution (Cloudinary's global network)
    ↓
Fast delivery to users worldwide
```

### Display Flow:
```
Page Loads
    ↓
LQIP placeholder shown (1KB blurred preview - instant!)
    ↓
User scrolls near image
    ↓
Lazy loader triggered (Intersection Observer)
    ↓
Browser selects best format & size:
├─ Mobile (375px): Loads 400w WebP (50KB)
├─ Tablet (768px): Loads 800w WebP (150KB)
└─ Desktop (1920px): Loads 1200w WebP (250KB)
    ↓
Image fades in smoothly (0.3s transition)
```

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Admin Panel - Upload Images

1. Go to Admin Panel → Create/Edit Post
2. Find the "Featured Image" section
3. **Option A:** Drag & drop image onto upload area
4. **Option B:** Click upload area to browse files
5. Wait for progress bar to complete
6. Image automatically optimized and saved!

### Automatic Optimization Applied:
- Original 2.5MB JPEG → 250KB WebP (90% smaller!)
- Multiple sizes generated for responsive delivery
- Stored on Cloudinary CDN
- URLs saved to database

---

### Frontend - Display Optimized Images

The system automatically handles image optimization. Just use standard HTML:

```html
<!-- Basic image tag -->
<img src="image-url" alt="Description" class="optimized-image">
```

The `image-optimizer.js` script will:
1. Add responsive srcset/sizes
2. Add lazy loading
3. Add progressive loading
4. Add LQIP placeholder

**Result:** Fast, responsive, optimized images with zero extra work!

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Image Quality Levels

Edit `services/cloudinary.service.js`:

```javascript
// High quality (larger files)
quality: 'auto:best'

// Balanced (default)
quality: 'auto:good'

// Small files (slightly lower quality)
quality: 'auto:eco'

// Maximum compression
quality: 'auto:low'
```

### Image Sizes

Edit the `IMAGE_SIZES` constant in `cloudinary.service.js`:

```javascript
const IMAGE_SIZES = {
    thumbnail: { width: 200, height: 200 },
    small: { width: 400, height: 300 },
    medium: { width: 800, height: 600 },
    large: { width: 1200, height: 900 },
    // Add custom sizes:
    xlarge: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }
};
```

### Upload Limits

Edit in `server.js`:

```javascript
const upload = multer({
    storage: multer.memoryStorage(),
    limits: {
        fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB max
    },
    fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
        // Allowed types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
    }
});
```

3. Login with admin credentials
4. Create new post
5. Upload an image (drag & drop or click)
6. Check console for upload progress
7. Verify image appears with optimizations

### Test Lazy Loading

1. Go to blog page: `http://localhost:3000/blog.html`
2. Open DevTools → Network tab

2. `scripts/image-optimizer.js` loaded in HTML
3. Images have correct class names
4. Console for JavaScript errors

**Fix:**
- Ensure script loads after DOM ready
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify HTML includes script tag

---

### Issue: Railway deployment fails

**Check:**
1. All Cloudinary variables added to Railway

3. Deployment logs for specific errors

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Verify variables are set
railway variables

# Redeploy
git push
```
