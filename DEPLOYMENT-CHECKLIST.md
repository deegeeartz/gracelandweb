## üöÇ Railway Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Railway Project

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://railway.app/
   - Login or sign up

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository: `gracelandweb`

3. **Wait for Initial Deploy**
   - Railway will auto-detect Node.js project
   - Initial deploy may fail (expected - missing env vars)

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Click **Variables** tab and add:

#### Database Variables
```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@host:port/database
DB_HOST=your-mysql-host
DB_USER=your-mysql-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-mysql-password
DB_NAME=graceland_db
DB_PORT=3306
```

#### Cloudinary Variables
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=graceland-church
CLOUDINARY_AUTO_OPTIMIZE=true
CLOUDINARY_QUALITY=auto:good
```

#### Application Variables
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-change-this
```

#### Admin Credentials (Optional - Create via Admin Panel)
```
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@rccggraceland.org
```

**Security Note:** Generate strong, unique secrets!

---

### Step 3: Configure MySQL Database

**Option A: Railway MySQL Plugin (Recommended)**

1. Click "New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "Add MySQL"
2. Railway auto-creates `DATABASE_URL`
3. Copy connection details to your variables
4. Run database schema:
   ```powershell
   # Connect to Railway MySQL via CLI
   mysql -h your-host -u root -p -D railway
   
   # Run schema
   source create-database.sql
   ```

**Option B: External MySQL (PlanetScale, etc.)**

1. Create database on PlanetScale/other provider
2. Get connection string
3. Add to Railway variables as `DATABASE_URL`
4. Run schema using provider's tools

---

### Step 4: Deploy Application

1. **Trigger Deployment**
   - Railway auto-deploys on git push
   - Or click "Deploy" in Railway dashboard

2. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Wait for "Success" status
   - Note: First deploy takes 2-5 minutes

3. **Get Deployment URL**
   - Click on deployment
   - Copy the generated URL (e.g., `graceland-web-production.up.railway.app`)

---

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Testing

#### Test Basic Functionality
- [ ] Visit deployment URL
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation works (Home, Blog, About, etc.)
- [ ] Images load from Cloudinary CDN
- [ ] Lazy loading works (scroll blog page)
- [ ] Responsive design works (mobile/tablet/desktop)

#### Test Admin Panel
- [ ] Go to `/admin.html`
- [ ] Login with admin credentials
- [ ] Dashboard shows statistics
- [ ] Create a test blog post
- [ ] Upload featured image (test Cloudinary)
- [ ] Publish post
- [ ] Verify post appears on blog page
- [ ] Edit post
- [ ] Delete post

#### Test Image Optimization
- [ ] Upload 2MB+ image in admin panel
- [ ] Check Cloudinary dashboard for uploaded image
- [ ] Verify image appears on frontend
- [ ] Check Network tab - should load ~200KB WebP version
- [ ] Test on mobile - should load smaller version
- [ ] Test lazy loading (image loads when scrolling)

#### Test Performance
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target 90+ score)
- [ ] Check page load time (<2 seconds)
- [ ] Verify images optimized (WebP format)
- [ ] Check CDN delivery (Cloudinary URLs)
- [ ] Test from different locations/devices

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build Fails

**Check:**
- All dependencies in `package.json`
- `package-lock.json` committed to repo
- No syntax errors in code
- Railway build logs for specific error

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Locally verify build works
npm install
npm start
```

---

### Issue: Database Connection Fails

**Check:**
- `DATABASE_URL` variable set correctly
- MySQL service running on Railway
- Firewall allows Railway IP addresses
- Database schema created

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Test database connection
node -e "
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');
mysql.createConnection(process.env.DATABASE_URL)
  .then(() => console.log('‚úÖ Database connected!'))
  .catch(err => console.error('‚ùå Error:', err));
"
```

---

### Issue: Images Not Uploading

**Check:**
- Cloudinary variables set in Railway
- No typos in variable names
- API key/secret valid
- Cloudinary account not exceeded limits

**Fix:**
1. Verify variables in Railway dashboard
2. Check Cloudinary dashboard for errors
3. Review Railway logs for upload errors

---

### Issue: Admin Login Fails

**Check:**
- Admin user created in database
- Password hashed correctly (bcrypt)
- `JWT_SECRET` set in Railway
- Session cookies enabled

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Create admin user manually
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password, role) 
VALUES ('admin', 'admin@rccggraceland.org', 
        '$2b$10$hashedpassword', 'admin');
```

---

### Issue: CORS Errors

**Check:**
- Frontend URL matches backend `CORS_ORIGIN`
- CORS middleware configured in `server.js`
- Railway deployment URL added to CORS whitelist

**Fix in `server.js`:**
```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: [
        'http://localhost:3000',
        'https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app'
    ],
    credentials: true
}));
```
