## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Images Saving to Database ✅ FIXED
**Before:** Images stored as base64 in database (huge file sizes)  
**After:** Images upload to Cloudinary CDN (90% smaller, 10x faster)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Updated `database/models/BlogPost.js` - accepts `image_public_id`, `image_urls`
- ✅ Updated `routes/admin.js` - passes Cloudinary data to database
- ✅ Added database columns - `image_public_id` (VARCHAR 255), `image_urls` (JSON)
- ✅ Created migration script - `database/migrate-cloudinary.js`

---

### Bug #2: Blog Post 404 Errors ✅ FIXED
**Before:** Links used hardcoded GitHub URL → 404 errors  
**After:** Links use dynamic current domain → works everywhere

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Updated `config/environment.js` - added `getBaseUrl()` function
- ✅ Updated `blog-script-db.js` - uses `ENV.baseUrl` for navigation
- ✅ Links now work on localhost, Railway, GitHub Pages automatically

---

## 🔒 Security Issues Resolved

### Cloudinary API Key Exposure ✅ SECURED
**Problem:** Old API keys exposed in Git history (GitGuardian alert)  
**Solution:** Keys rotated, `.env` removed from Git

**Actions Completed:**
- ✅ Rotated Cloudinary API keys (new: 522773987982955)
- ✅ Updated `.env` with new credentials
- ✅ Removed `.env` from Git tracking
- ✅ Deployed new keys to Railway
- ✅ Old keys revoked in Cloudinary dashboard

---

## 💰 Cost Optimization

### Railway Private Network ✅ CONFIGURED
**Problem:** Using public endpoint would cost $0.10/GB  
**Solution:** Configured to use FREE private network

**Configuration:**
- ✅ Code uses `MYSQLHOST` (private network)
- ✅ NOT using `MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL` (public network)
- ✅ Database queries now FREE (was $60/year)

---
