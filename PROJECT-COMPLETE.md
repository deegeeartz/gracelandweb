## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Created/Updated:

- ✅ `robots.txt` - SEO robots file
- ✅ `sitemap.xml` - SEO sitemap

---

## 💡 How It Works

### **On Your Local Machine:**
```
1. You open: http://localhost:3000
2. environment.js detects: hostname = "localhost"
3. Automatically uses: http://localhost:3000/api
4. Connects to: Local MySQL database
```

### **On GitHub Pages (Production):**
```
1. User opens: https://username.github.io/rccg-graceland-website/
2. environment.js detects: hostname ≠ "localhost"  
3. Automatically uses: https://your-backend.railway.app/api
4. Connects to: Railway/Render MySQL database
```

### **The Magic:** ✨
You never have to change any configuration manually! The system automatically knows where it's running and uses the correct backend!
