## ðŸ“Œ Still Confused About the URL?

**Backend URL** = Where your Node.js server lives  
- Looks like: `https://something.up.railway.app`
- Find it: Railway â†’ Web Service â†’ Settings â†’ Domains

**Database URL** = MySQL connection (different thing!)  
- Looks like: `mysql://root:password@mysql.railway...`
- You DON'T need this for the frontend!

## That's it! Just run `fix-admin.bat` ðŸŽ¯
